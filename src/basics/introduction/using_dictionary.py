# Dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.

# It is generally used when we have a huge amount of data.
# Dictionaries are optimized for retrieving data.
# We must know the key to retrieve the value.

# In Python, dictionaries are defined within braces {} with each item being a pair in the form key:value.
# Key and value can be of any type.
